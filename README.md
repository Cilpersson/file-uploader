Coding test
Your task is to build a web application that processes files containing text.
The user should upload a file from his or her browser to the server and then be presented with the processed text.
In the processed text the application should surround every occurrence of the most used word with foo and bar.
Example: if the most used word is 'hiq', the processed text should display 'foohiqbar' instead of 'hiq'.
In this repository you'll find some useful textfiles for testing your application.
Choose one of the options below for your web application:
Develop a web application (frontend only)
Develop a restful web API (backend only)
Develop a web application with a restful web API and frontend
You are free to choose what specific technologies to use in this assignment, however we suggest
ASP.NET  Core, ASP.NET  Framework for backend
JavaScript, React/Vue/Angular for frontend
Webpack
Automated tests are nice, but not mandatory
Please list of all your technical choises and motivate them
