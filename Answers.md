### 1.  How long time did you end up spending on this coding test?
I think I spent a little more time than I first intended. I started trying to do a back- and frontend solution. However I didn't feel as if I understood everything I did in the backend part of the code and therefore I decided to start from scratch and only do a frontend solution. We have not yet started with Node.js (we will do so in about four weeks) but I will redo this test when I have that knowledge, it will be good practice for me. 

An estimation in total, including the first attempt, might be somewhere around **15-20 hours**. 

### 2.  Explain why you chose the code structure(s) you used in your solution.
I decided solve it with **React**, we have been doing a bit of React now and I like it a lot. So using that knowledge and applying it on a non course related project seemed like a fun challenge. 

I decided to create three main **components**: **Upload**, **WordSorting** and **WordStyling**. As those where the three main things the test required. Maybe I could have added smaller components for some of the sorting and textstyling functions, but I'm also happy with the structure of my code as it is.

I used **useState**  to check for successful uploads and setting the file and used **Regular expression** when replacing the most occurring word(s). 

### 3.  What would you add to your solution if you had more time? This question is especially important if you did not spend much time on the coding test - use this as an opportunity to explain what your solution is missing.

If I hade more time I would create a  fullstack solution, but that would require a lot of time reading and deep diving and unfortunately I don't have that time with the Technigo course taking up quite a lot, almost all, of my time. 
### 4.  What did you think of this recruitment test?
This was a great test and I enjoyed it. It was challenging at times but I overcame all the obstacles along the way and that makes me super proud.
